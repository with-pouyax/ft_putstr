# ft_putstr

Welcome to the repository of the `ft_putstr` function, a fundamental component designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in handling strings and character arrays in C, specifically focusing on direct system calls for output operations.

## Description

The `ft_putstr` function takes a character string as an argument and outputs it to the standard output. It iterates through each character of the string and uses the `write` system call to print each character individually. This function is a basic but essential tool for anyone learning C, as it delves into string manipulation, loops, and the use of system-level functions.
